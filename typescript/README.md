# ActionableAgile Analytics Tool


## Installation
>NOTE: Analytics tool requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run. 
If you don't have Node installed, please install it before continuing. 

Download jira_to_analytics.js and config.yaml from the releases page on github (https://github.com/actionableagile/jira-to-analytics/releases) and put both files in the same directory. Which directory you choose doesnâ€™t matter as long as they are co-located. Edit the config file and customize it for your specific Jira instance according to the instructions in the previous README. Open a command prompt and run it by simply typing ```node jira-to-analytics``` (no additional command line parameters are needed). If the program succeeds, the output data file will be written in the same directory as the javascript file
.
## Using the Application

To run the JIRA extraction process, run ```node jira-to-analytics```


> NOTE: There has been an update to the YAML file format. Please see the [config.yaml][config-yaml] file to see an example of the new schema. For those that wish to continue to use the old version of the schema, please enable the legacy flag (```--legacy```). 
##### Configurable settings/flags

```-i``` specifies input config file name (defaults to config.yaml)

```-o``` specifies output file name (must end with .csv or .json, defaults to data.csv)

```--legacy``` will enable the old version of the YAML (from the GO version of the application). 




For example, to run the tool with a legacy config file named myconfig.yaml and exporting data to  mydata.csv:

```node jira-to-analytics -i myconfig.yaml --legacy -o my.csv```
